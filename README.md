The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in object-oriented programming. Here's a brief overview of each SOLID principle and how you can apply them in C#.

Below is a simple C# implementation of a Smart Bank system that adheres to the SOLID principles, including Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open/Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
